/**
 * @title LookCoin Upgrade Migration Tests
 * @dev Comprehensive test suite for UUPS proxy upgrades covering:
 * - Live upgrade scenarios with pending cross-chain messages
 * - Storage layout migration validation
 * - Multi-contract coordinated upgrades  
 * - Emergency upgrade procedures
 * - Cross-version compatibility testing
 * - Upgrade rollback mechanisms
 * 
 * Test Strategy:
 * 1. Validate storage layout preservation across versions
 * 2. Test upgrades during active cross-chain operations
 * 3. Verify state migration and data integrity
 * 4. Test emergency upgrade procedures under attack scenarios
 * 5. Validate coordinated multi-contract upgrades
 * 6. Test rollback procedures and version compatibility
 * 
 * Security Focus:
 * - Ensure no storage collisions during upgrades
 * - Validate proper access control enforcement during upgrades
 * - Test upgrade atomicity and transaction safety
 * - Verify cross-chain state consistency after upgrades
 * - Test emergency upgrade procedures under time constraints
