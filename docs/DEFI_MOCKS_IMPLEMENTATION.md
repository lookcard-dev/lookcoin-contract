# DeFi Protocol Mocks Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented sophisticated DeFi protocol mocks to enable comprehensive economic attack testing for the LookCoin test suite. These mocks provide realistic simulations of flash loans, DEX pools, lending protocols, and price oracles with proper financial accounting.

## Implemented Components

### 1. MockFlashLoanProvider.sol
**Purpose**: Simulates flash loan protocols (Aave V3 and Compound V3 style)

**Key Features**:
- Dual protocol support with both Aave and Compound interfaces
- Dynamic fee calculation with volume discounts (default 0.09% fee)
- Complete double-entry accounting for all operations
- MEV protection with same-block lending prevention
- Support for multiple simultaneous flash loans
- Comprehensive event logging for attack analysis
- Loan position tracking with immutable audit trails

**Financial Accounting**:
- Every flash loan creates a debit (loan receivable) and credit (asset transfer)
- Repayment records debit (asset received) and credit (loan receivable + fee income)
- Reserve tracking for protocol revenue
- Volume-based fee discounting mechanism

### 2. MockDEXPool.sol
**Purpose**: Simulates AMM DEX pools for sandwich attack and MEV testing

**Key Features**:
- Constant product formula (x*y=k) implementation
- Realistic slippage and price impact calculation
- MEV opportunity generation and tracking
- Sandwich attack detection algorithm
- TWAP oracle functionality
- Flash swap support
- LP token management with proper minting/burning

**Financial Mechanics**:
- Maintains constant product invariant with fees
- Tracks reserve ratios for price discovery
- Implements 0.3% swap fee (Uniswap V2 standard)
- Price impact calculation for large trades
- Front-running and back-running detection

### 3. MockLendingProtocol.sol
**Purpose**: Comprehensive lending protocol for economic manipulation testing

**Key Features**:
- Collateralized borrowing with dynamic LTV ratios
- Variable interest rate model with kink at 80% utilization
- Liquidation mechanics with 5% bonus incentive
- Health factor calculation (minimum 1.0)
- Interest accrual using compound formula
- Reserve factor for protocol revenue (10%)
- Multi-asset market support

**Financial Model**:
- Supply and borrow indices for interest accrual
- Jump rate model: 2% base + 5% * utilization (below kink)
- Above kink: adds 100% APR for excess utilization
- Liquidation threshold at 85% LTV
- Maximum 50% liquidation per transaction

### 4. MockPriceOracle.sol
**Purpose**: Sophisticated price oracle with manipulation scenarios

**Key Features**:
- Multi-source price aggregation with confidence scoring
- TWAP calculation over 1-hour periods
- Price manipulation detection with circuit breakers
- 20% maximum deviation threshold
- Staleness checks (1-hour timeout)
- Flash crash simulation capability
- Manipulation score tracking for suspicious actors

**Security Features**:
- Minimum 3 price sources required
- 80% confidence threshold for valid prices
- Weighted average by confidence scores
- Circuit breaker activation on repeated manipulation
- Historical price tracking (last 100 prices)

## Integration with Attack Contracts

### Enhanced LiquidityDrainer
- Integrated with MockFlashLoanProvider for leveraged attacks
- Implements IFlashLoanReceiver interface
- Flash loan callback with proper repayment logic
- 10x leverage capability for drainage attempts
- State tracking during flash loan execution

### Attack Scenarios Enabled

1. **Flash Loan Attacks**:
   - Capital-efficient liquidity drainage
   - Flash loan arbitrage with DEX manipulation
   - Collateral-free attack execution

2. **Sandwich Attacks**:
   - Front-running detection in DEX pools
   - MEV extraction tracking
   - Profit calculation from sandwich attacks

3. **Oracle Manipulation**:
   - Price deviation attacks
   - Flash crash scenarios
   - Coordinated multi-asset manipulation

4. **Lending Exploits**:
   - Undercollateralized borrowing attempts
   - Liquidation cascades
   - Interest rate manipulation

## Financial Accounting Principles

### Double-Entry Bookkeeping
All financial operations maintain balanced accounting:
- Flash loans: Debit loan receivable, Credit asset
- Swaps: Debit token received, Credit token sent
- Lending: Debit supply position, Credit asset deposited
- Fees: Debit asset, Credit fee income

### Conservation of Value
- No tokens created or destroyed (except authorized minting)
- All fees properly accounted and withdrawable
- Interest accrual maintains total value invariants
- Liquidation bonuses funded by borrower penalties

### Audit Trail
- Immutable event logs for all operations
- Position tracking with timestamps
- Historical data preservation
- Manipulation attempt recording

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests
- Flash loan execution and repayment
- DEX swap mechanics and slippage
- Lending collateralization and liquidation
- Oracle price aggregation and TWAP

### Integration Tests
- Flash loan + DEX arbitrage
- Sandwich attack detection
- Cross-protocol interactions
- Economic attack simulations

### Attack Resistance Tests
- 25+ economic attack scenarios
- MEV extraction prevention
- Price manipulation detection
- Liquidity drainage resistance

## Gas Optimization

### Via IR Compilation
- Enabled `viaIR: true` in Hardhat config
- Resolves stack too deep issues
- Optimizes contract bytecode
- Maintains 9999 optimizer runs

### Efficient Patterns
- Batch operations for multiple loans
- Simplified array management
- Optimized price calculations
- Minimal storage operations

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**:
   - Owner-only admin functions
   - Authorized price sources
   - Internal-only callbacks

2. **Reentrancy Protection**:
   - NonReentrant modifiers on all external functions
   - Check-effects-interactions pattern

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Parameter bounds checking
   - Zero address validation
   - Overflow prevention

4. **Economic Security**:
   - Maximum fee limits
   - Minimum liquidity requirements
   - Circuit breakers for anomalies

## Usage Example

```solidity
// Deploy mocks
MockFlashLoanProvider flashLoanProvider = new MockFlashLoanProvider();
MockDEXPool dexPool = new MockDEXPool(token0, token1);
MockLendingProtocol lendingProtocol = new MockLendingProtocol(priceOracle);
MockPriceOracle priceOracle = new MockPriceOracle();

// Configure
flashLoanProvider.setFlashLoanFee(address(lookCoin), 9); // 0.09%
dexPool.setSwapFee(30); // 0.3%
lendingProtocol.listMarket(address(lookCoin), 7500, true);
priceOracle.addPriceSource(trustedSource);

// Execute attack simulation
LiquidityDrainer drainer = new LiquidityDrainer(lookCoin, router);
drainer.setFlashLoanProvider(address(flashLoanProvider));
drainer.attemptLiquidityDrainage(targetChain, amount, true); // Use flash loan
```
