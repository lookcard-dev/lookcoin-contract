## Security Architecture Overview

LookCoin implements a comprehensive security framework designed to protect the omnichain token ecosystem. The security architecture consists of multiple layers:

### Core Security Mechanisms

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Granular permission system using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl
   - Distinct roles for different administrative functions
   - Separation of concerns between operational and governance roles

2. **Reentrancy Protection**
   - All external functions use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
   - Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern enforced
   - No external calls before state changes

3. **Pausability**
   - Emergency pause mechanism for all critical operations
   - Immediate response capability without timelock delays
   - Granular pause controls per bridge module

4. **Upgrade Security**
   - UUPS proxy pattern with restricted upgrade authorization
   - Only UPGRADER_ROLE (held by governance vault) can upgrade
   - Implementation verification before upgrade execution

### MPC Vault Governance

The system uses an external MPC (Multi-Party Computation) vault wallet for governance:
- No single point of failure
- Direct execution model without on-chain delays
- Secure multi-party authorization for critical operations
- Off-chain coordination with on-chain execution

## Access Control Structure

### Role Definitions

#### LookCoin Contract Roles

| Role | Purpose | Typical Holder |
|------|---------|----------------|

activateEmergencyMode()     EMERGENCY_ROLE         Oracle
```

## Cross-Chain Security

### LayerZero Integration

1. **Trusted Remote Validation**
   - Only registered remote contracts can send messages
   - Source address verification on every message
   - Chain ID validation

2. **DVN (Decentralized Verifier Network) Configuration**
   - Multiple independent verifiers required
   - Configurable threshold for consensus
   - Optional and required DVN separation

3. **Nonce Tracking**
   - Prevents replay attacks
   - Sequential message ordering
   - Per-chain nonce management

### Celer IM Security

1. **Message Authentication**
   - MessageBus validates all incoming messages
   - Remote module address verification
   - Sender authentication

2. **Transfer ID Tracking**
   - Unique transfer IDs prevent duplicates
   - Processed transfer tracking
   - Idempotent message handling

3. **Fee Management**
   - Configurable fee parameters with bounds
   - Separate fee collector address
   - Min/max fee limits

### IBC Security

1. **Validator Consensus**
   - Minimum 21 validators required
   - 2/3+ threshold for packet validation
   - Signature verification for each validator

2. **Packet Validation**
   - Timeout verification
   - Duplicate packet prevention
   - Validator signature aggregation

3. **Unbonding Period**
   - 14-day unbonding for validator changes
   - Prevents rapid validator set manipulation
   - Time for detection of malicious behavior

## Emergency Procedures

### 1. Emergency Pause

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Detected exploit or vulnerability
- Abnormal supply changes (>1% deviation)
- Cross-chain message anomalies
- Governance decision

**Procedure:**
```solidity
// 1. Pause all operations
lookCoin.pause()
celerIMModule.pause()
ibcModule.pause()

// 2. Activate emergency mode on oracle
supplyOracle.activateEmergencyMode()

// 3. Investigate and remediate
// 4. Unpause after resolution
```

### 2. Supply Reconciliation

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Supply mismatch detected by oracle
- Manual reconciliation request
- Post-incident recovery

**Procedure:**
```solidity
// 1. Pause affected bridges
supplyOracle.pauseBridge(bridgeAddress)

// 2. Force reconciliation
supplyOracle.forceReconcile()

// 3. Verify supply accuracy
// 4. Resume operations
```

### 3. Bridge Isolation

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Specific bridge compromise
- Network-specific issues
- Targeted attack

**Procedure:**
```solidity
// 1. Disable specific bridge
supplyOracle.disableBridge(bridgeAddress)

// 2. Prevent further transfers
// Bridge remains registered but inactive

// 3. Investigate and fix
// 4. Re-enable when safe
supplyOracle.enableBridge(bridgeAddress)
```

### 4. Emergency Withdrawal

**Use Cases:**
- Stuck tokens recovery
- Contract migration
- Critical bug remediation

**Procedure:**
```solidity
// Only with governance approval
bridgeModule.emergencyWithdraw(token, recipient, amount)
```
