## Security Architecture Overview

LookCoin implements a comprehensive security framework designed to protect the omnichain token ecosystem. The security architecture consists of multiple layers:

### Core Security Mechanisms

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Granular permission system using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl
   - Distinct roles for different administrative functions
   - Separation of concerns between operational and governance roles

2. **Reentrancy Protection**
   - All external functions use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
   - Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern enforced
   - No external calls before state changes

3. **Pausability**
   - Emergency pause mechanism for all critical operations
   - Immediate response capability without timelock delays
   - Granular pause controls per bridge module

4. **Upgrade Security**
   - UUPS proxy pattern with restricted upgrade authorization
   - Only UPGRADER_ROLE (held by governance vault) can upgrade
   - Implementation verification before upgrade execution

### MPC Vault Governance

The system uses an external MPC (Multi-Party Computation) vault wallet for governance:
- No single point of failure
- Direct execution model without on-chain delays
- Secure multi-party authorization for critical operations
- Off-chain coordination with on-chain execution

## Cross-Chain Security

### LayerZero Integration

1. **Trusted Remote Validation**
   - Only registered remote contracts can send messages
   - Source address verification on every message
   - Chain ID validation

2. **DVN (Decentralized Verifier Network) Configuration**
   - Multiple independent verifiers required
   - Configurable threshold for consensus
   - Optional and required DVN separation

3. **Nonce Tracking**
   - Prevents replay attacks
   - Sequential message ordering
   - Per-chain nonce management

### Celer IM Security

1. **Message Authentication**
   - MessageBus validates all incoming messages
   - Remote module address verification
   - Sender authentication

2. **Transfer ID Tracking**
   - Unique transfer IDs prevent duplicates
   - Processed transfer tracking
   - Idempotent message handling

3. **Fee Management**
   - Configurable fee parameters with bounds
   - Separate fee collector address
   - Min/max fee limits

### Hyperlane Security

1. **Interchain Security Module (ISM)**
   - Modular security approach with configurable validators
   - Domain-specific security configurations
   - Message authentication via ISM verification

2. **Domain Validation**
   - Supported domains mapping prevents unauthorized chains
   - Domain ID verification on every message
   - Mailbox address validation per domain

3. **Message Security**
   - Unique message IDs prevent replay attacks
   - Origin domain verification
   - Sender authentication through mailbox

4. **Gas Payment**
   - Required gas payment for message delivery
   - Prevents spam and ensures message processing
   - Configurable gas oracles per domain

## Emergency Procedures

### 1. Emergency Pause

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Detected exploit or vulnerability
- Abnormal supply changes (>1% deviation)
- Cross-chain message anomalies
- Governance decision

**Procedure:**
```solidity
// 1. Pause all operations
lookCoin.pause()
celerIMModule.pause()
// Or use SecurityManager for protocol-specific pause
securityManager.pauseProtocol(Protocol.LayerZero)
securityManager.pauseProtocol(Protocol.Celer)
securityManager.pauseProtocol(Protocol.Hyperlane)

// 2. Activate emergency mode on oracle
supplyOracle.activateEmergencyMode()

// 3. Investigate and remediate
// 4. Unpause after resolution
```

### 2. Supply Reconciliation

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Supply mismatch detected by oracle
- Manual reconciliation request
- Post-incident recovery

**Procedure:**
```solidity
// 1. Pause affected bridges
supplyOracle.pauseBridge(bridgeAddress)

// 2. Force reconciliation
supplyOracle.forceReconcile()

// 3. Verify supply accuracy
// 4. Resume operations
```

### 3. Bridge Isolation

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Specific bridge compromise
- Network-specific issues
- Targeted attack

**Procedure:**
```solidity
// 1. Disable specific bridge
supplyOracle.disableBridge(bridgeAddress)

// 2. Prevent further transfers
// Bridge remains registered but inactive

// 3. Investigate and fix
// 4. Re-enable when safe
supplyOracle.enableBridge(bridgeAddress)
```

### 4. Emergency Withdrawal

**Use Cases:**
- Stuck tokens recovery
- Contract migration
- Critical bug remediation

**Procedure:**
```solidity
// Only with governance approval
bridgeModule.emergencyWithdraw(token, recipient, amount)
```

## Multi-Signature Oracle Security

The SupplyOracle implements a multi-signature validation system for supply updates, ensuring data integrity through consensus mechanisms.

### Security Architecture

1. **Multi-Oracle Consensus**
   - Requires 3 independent oracle signatures by default
   - Each oracle must report identical supply data
   - Prevents single point of failure in supply reporting

2. **Signature Validation Process**
   ```solidity
   // Each oracle signs with identical parameters
   updateSupply(chainId, totalSupply, lockedSupply, nonce)
   
   // Contract tracks signatures per update hash
   mapping(bytes32 => mapping(address => bool)) updateSignatures
   mapping(bytes32 => uint256) updateSignatureCount
   ```

3. **Security Benefits**
   - **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Can tolerate up to (n-1)/2 malicious oracles
   - **Data Integrity**: Multiple independent sources validate supply data
   - **Attack Resistance**: Compromising one oracle doesn't affect system
   - **Audit Trail**: All oracle submissions are logged on-chain

### Operational Security

1. **Oracle Node Distribution**
   - Geographic distribution across different regions
   - Different cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)
   - Independent RPC endpoints
   - Separate monitoring systems

2. **Key Management**
   - Each oracle has unique private key
   - Keys stored in secure environments (HSM/KMS)
   - Regular key rotation procedures
   - No shared credentials between oracles

3. **Coordination Mechanism**
   - Nonce-based synchronization (timestamp or block number)
   - No direct communication between oracles
   - Independent data collection and validation

### Attack Scenarios & Mitigations

| Attack Vector | Mitigation |
|--------------|------------|
| Single oracle compromise | Requires 3 signatures; one compromised oracle cannot update supply |
| Data manipulation | All oracles must agree on exact values |
| Replay attacks | Nonce prevents replay of old updates |
| Denial of service | System continues with remaining healthy oracles |
| Collusion attack | Requires compromising majority of oracles |

### Configuration Security

- Only MPC Vault can change signature threshold
- Minimum threshold enforced (cannot set to 0 or 1)
- Maximum threshold prevents operational deadlock
- Role separation between oracle operators and administrators
