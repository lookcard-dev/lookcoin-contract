## Migration Context and Background

### Previous Phases Completed
- **Phase 1.1**: LevelDB analysis revealed 13 missing infrastructure contracts
- **Phase 1.2**: State management abstraction architecture with dual-write capability
- **Phase 1.3**: Enhanced JSON schema v2.0.0 supporting all 28 contracts
- **Phase 1.4**: Comprehensive testing strategy with 100+ test cases

### Current Migration Scope
- **28 Smart Contracts** across 5 blockchain networks
- **Networks**: BSC Mainnet (8 contracts), BSC Testnet (9 contracts), Base Sepolia (3 contracts), Optimism Sepolia (3 contracts), Sapphire Testnet (3 contracts)
