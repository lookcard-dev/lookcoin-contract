- **Logical Organization**: Group tests by functionality (Security, Configuration, Operations, etc.)
- **Strategic Setup**: Use `beforeEach` for common setup while maintaining test independence
- **Specialized Assertions**: Use helper functions (`assertBalanceChanges`, `assertSupplyChanges`, `expectSpecificRevert`)

## Migration Notes

### From Scattered to Consolidated Structure

The test suite has been reorganized from a scattered structure with 20+ files into a consolidated structure:

**Previous Structure** (scattered):
- Multiple small files per contract component
- Separated security and functional testing
- Duplicated setup and configuration code
- Inconsistent testing patterns

**Current Structure** (consolidated):
- Comprehensive test files covering entire contracts
- Integrated security and functional testing
- Shared infrastructure and helper functions
- Consistent testing patterns and standards

This consolidation provides better maintainability, comprehensive coverage, and improved developer experience while maintaining the same level of security and functional validation.
