# Implementation Plan

## Summary

The native cross-chain token implementation has been completed with the following key architectural decisions:

1. **Delegation Pattern Architecture**: Instead of inheriting from all protocol interfaces (which would break storage layout for upgrades), we implemented a delegation pattern where:
   - LookCoin contract maintains core ERC20 functionality with direct integration of LayerZero, xERC20, and Hyperlane
   - Complex protocol logic is delegated to separate module contracts
   - CrossChainRouter provides a unified interface for all protocols

2. **Completed Components**:
   - ✅ All four cross-chain protocols implemented (LayerZero, Celer IM, xERC20, Hyperlane)
   - ✅ Unified routing through CrossChainRouter
   - ✅ Fee management and comparison system
   - ✅ Comprehensive security measures including rate limiting
   - ✅ Protocol registry for dynamic protocol management
   - ✅ Complete test coverage for all components
   - ✅ Deployment and configuration infrastructure

3. **xERC20 Enhancement**: xERC20 functionality was implemented but can be toggled on/off for safety, allowing controlled enablement
