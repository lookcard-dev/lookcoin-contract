# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms LookCoin into a native cross-chain ready token by integrating multiple cross-chain protocols: LayerZero OFT V2, Celer IM, Hyperlane, and SuperChain xERC20. The enhancement will provide users with seamless cross-chain functionality, multiple bridging options for redundancy and cost optimization, modular security through Hyperlane's validator sets, and native support for the Optimism SuperChain ecosystem.

## Requirements

2. WHEN configuring LayerZero endpoints THEN the system SHALL set up proper endpoint addresses for each supported chain
3. WHEN handling cross-chain transfers THEN the system SHALL implement proper token burning on source chain and minting on destination chain
4. WHEN processing LayerZero messages THEN the system SHALL validate message authenticity and prevent replay attacks
5. WHEN setting gas limits THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate gas limits for cross-chain transactions
6. WHEN handling failed transfers THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry mechanisms and refund logic
7. WHEN managing token supply THEN the system SHALL ensure total supply consistency across all chains

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DeFi user, I want LookCoin to support Celer IM (Inter-chain Messaging), so that I have an alternative cross-chain bridging option with different security assumptions and cost structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating Celer IM THEN the system SHALL implement IMessageReceiverApp interface
2. WHEN processing Celer messages THEN the system SHALL validate message sender and chain ID

5. WHEN managing Celer fees THEN the system SHALL handle fee calculation and payment for cross-chain messages
6. WHEN handling Celer failures THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and user notification
7. WHEN ensuring security THEN the system SHALL validate Celer SGN signatures and prevent unauthorized minting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an Optimism ecosystem participant, I want LookCoin to be compatible with SuperChain xERC20 standard, so that I can seamlessly use the token across all Optimism chains with native bridging support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing xERC20 THEN the system SHALL inherit from xERC20 interface and implement required functions
2. WHEN configuring bridge limits THEN the system SHALL set appropriate minting and burning limits for authorized bridges
3. WHEN managing bridge permissions THEN the system SHALL implement proper access control for bridge operations
4. WHEN handling SuperChain transfers THEN the system SHALL support native OP Stack bridging mechanisms
5. WHEN setting rate limits THEN the system SHALL configure per-bridge rate limiting for security
6. WHEN managing bridge registry THEN the system SHALL maintain a registry of authorized bridges
7. WHEN handling bridge failures THEN the system SHALL implement proper fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DeFi protocol integrator, I want LookCoin to support Hyperlane for cross-chain messaging, so that I can benefit from modular security and customizable validator sets for different risk profiles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating Hyperlane THEN the system SHALL implement IMessageRecipient interface for receiving cross-chain messages
2. WHEN configuring Hyperlane mailbox THEN the system SHALL set up proper Mailbox contract addresses for supported chains
3. WHEN handling Hyperlane transfers THEN the system SHALL implement secure message verification using Hyperlane's ISM (Interchain Security Module)
4. WHEN managing validator sets THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate validator thresholds and security modules per chain
5. WHEN processing Hyperlane messages THEN the system SHALL validate message origin and prevent unauthorized token operations
6. WHEN handling gas payments THEN the system SHALL integrate with Hyperlane's gas payment system for cross-chain transaction fees
7. WHEN ensuring message delivery THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry mechanisms for failed Hyperlane messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a smart contract developer, I want a unified interface for all cross-chain operations, so that I can easily integrate LookCoin's cross-chain functionality into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing unified interface THEN the system SHALL create a single contract interface for all cross-chain operations
2. WHEN routing transfers THEN the system SHALL automatically select the optimal bridge based on destination chain and cost
3. WHEN handling multiple protocols THEN the system SHALL provide consistent function signatures across all bridge types
4. WHEN managing protocol selection THEN the system SHALL allow users to specify preferred bridging protocol
5. WHEN providing status updates THEN the system SHALL emit standardized events for all cross-chain operations
6. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error messages across all protocols
7. WHEN documenting interfaces THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive NatSpec documentation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a token administrator, I want comprehensive governance controls over cross-chain functionality, so that I can manage protocol parameters, emergency situations, and system upgrades safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing protocol parameters THEN the system SHALL provide admin functions to update bridge configurations
2. WHEN handling emergencies THEN the system SHALL implement pause mechanisms for each cross-chain protocol
3. WHEN upgrading contracts THEN the system SHALL support safe upgrade patterns without breaking cross-chain state
4. WHEN managing fees THEN the system SHALL provide admin controls for cross-chain fee parameters
5. WHEN configuring limits THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of transfer limits per protocol and chain
6. WHEN monitoring health THEN the system SHALL provide functions to check the status of each cross-chain protocol
7. WHEN handling security incidents THEN the system SHALL implement emergency stop mechanisms with proper recovery procedures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user performing cross-chain transfers, I want transparent fee estimation and optimal routing, so that I can make informed decisions about which bridge to use for my transfers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN estimating fees THEN the system SHALL provide accurate fee quotes for each available bridge option
2. WHEN comparing routes THEN the system SHALL display estimated time, cost, and security level for each option
3. WHEN selecting optimal route THEN the system SHALL recommend the best bridge based on user preferences
4. WHEN handling fee payments THEN the system SHALL clearly separate bridge fees from token transfer amounts
5. WHEN providing estimates THEN the system SHALL account for gas costs on both source and destination chains
6. WHEN updating fee data THEN the system SHALL refresh fee estimates based on current network conditions
7. WHEN displaying options THEN the system SHALL show available liquidity and transfer limits for each bridge

### Requirement 7
