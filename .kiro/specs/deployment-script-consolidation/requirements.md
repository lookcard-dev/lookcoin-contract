# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature consolidates the LookCoin deployment, setup, and configuration scripts into a unified system. Currently, there are multiple deployment scripts (`deploy.ts`, `deploy-multi-protocol.ts`) and configuration scripts (`configure.ts`, `configure-multi-protocol.ts`) that create confusion and maintenance overhead. The goal is to create a single, comprehensive deployment system that handles all deployment scenarios while updating the documentation to reflect the streamlined process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single deployment script that handles contract deployment/upgrade for a single network, so that I don't need to choose between multiple deployment approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run a deployment command for a network THEN the system SHALL use a unified deployment script that operates only on that single network
2. WHEN the deployment script runs THEN it SHALL focus solely on contract deployment and upgrades for the target network
3. WHEN deployment completes THEN it SHALL save deployment artifacts and provide instructions for the next setup phase
4. IF a deployment fails at any stage THEN the system SHALL provide clear rollback information and resume capabilities for that specific network

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single setup script that handles local contract configuration for a single network, so that I can configure all local settings in one operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run setup on a network THEN the system SHALL use a unified setup script that operates only on that single network
2. WHEN setup runs THEN it SHALL configure local contract variables, roles, and settings for the current network only
3. WHEN setup completes THEN it SHALL prepare the contracts for cross-chain configuration and provide instructions for the configure phase
4. IF setup encounters missing deployments THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages directing to run deployment first

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single configuration script that handles cross-chain parameters for a single network, so that I can establish cross-chain connections from that network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run configuration on a network THEN the system SHALL use a unified configuration script that operates only on that single network
2. WHEN configuration runs THEN it SHALL load deployment artifacts from other networks and configure cross-chain connections from the current network to them
3. WHEN cross-chain configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL set up trusted remotes, bridge connections, and cross-chain parameters for the current network
4. IF cross-tier configuration is detected THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate warnings and safety checks for the current network only

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want updated deployment documentation that reflects the three-phase process, so that I can follow a clear workflow with separate deploy, setup, and configure phases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read the deployment documentation THEN it SHALL describe the three-phase process: deploy, setup, and configure
2. WHEN following the documentation THEN it SHALL provide clear step-by-step instructions for each phase and when to run them
3. WHEN the documentation describes network-specific commands THEN it SHALL use the unified script names for each phase
4. IF there are dependencies between phases THEN the documentation SHALL clearly explain the required sequence

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the npm scripts to be simplified and consistent, so that I can easily run each phase for any single network without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look at package.json scripts THEN there SHALL be consistent deploy, setup, and configure command patterns for each individual network
2. WHEN I run a deploy command for a network THEN it SHALL handle only contract deployment for that network
3. WHEN I run a setup command for a network THEN it SHALL handle only local contract configuration for that network
4. WHEN I run a configure command for a network THEN it SHALL handle only cross-chain parameter setup for that network

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want backward compatibility during the transition, so that existing deployment artifacts and processes continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new system encounters existing deployment artifacts THEN it SHALL read and upgrade them seamlessly
2. WHEN legacy deployment files exist THEN the system SHALL provide migration guidance
3. WHEN running on networks with existing deployments THEN the system SHALL detect and reuse existing contracts appropriately
4. IF there are conflicts between old and new deployment formats THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution steps
