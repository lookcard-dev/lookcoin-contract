## Deployment Process

LookCoin uses a **three-stage deployment process** with the new unified JSON state management system:

### Deployment Stages

| Stage         | Script         | Purpose                                   | Prerequisites                            | State Management                               |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Deploy**    | `deploy.ts`    | Create contracts and deployment artifacts | Network RPC access                       | Creates unified JSON deployment files          |
| **Setup**     | `setup.ts`     | Configure local roles and settings        | Deploy stage complete                    | Updates deployment state with configurations   |
| **Configure** | `configure.ts` | Establish cross-chain connections         | Deployment artifacts from other networks | Validates and updates cross-chain connections  |

**Migration Note**: All deployment scripts now use the unified JSON state management system. Legacy LevelDB support has been completely replaced. See [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) and [STATE_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md](docs/STATE_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

### New State Management Commands

The unified JSON system introduces enhanced validation and monitoring capabilities:

```bash
# Deployment validation
npm run validate:deployment              # Validate deployment file integrity
npm run migration:validate              # Compare deployments across systems

# Performance monitoring  
npm run benchmark                       # Run performance benchmarks
npm run benchmark:quick                 # Quick performance validation
npm run benchmark:production            # Production-grade benchmarking

# Backup and recovery
npm run backup:create                   # Create deployment backups
npm run backup:verify                   # Verify backup integrity
```

### Stage 1: Deploy

Creates smart contracts and generates unified JSON deployment artifacts on a single network:

```bash
# Deploy to specific networks (now with unified JSON backend)
npm run deploy:bsc-testnet              # Creates bsctestnet.unified.json
npm run deploy:base-sepolia             # Creates basesepolia.unified.json  
npm run deploy:op-sepolia               # Creates optimismsepolia.unified.json
npm run deploy:sapphire-mainnet         # Creates sapphiremainnet.unified.json
```

This stage uses Hardhat Ignition modules with the new UnifiedJSONStateManager to deploy contracts and create comprehensive deployment artifacts with enhanced schema v3.0.0.

### Stage 2: Setup

Configures local roles and registers bridges post-deployment:

```bash
# Setup after deployment
npm run setup:bsc-testnet
npm run setup:base-sepolia
npm run setup:op-sepolia
npm run setup:sapphire-mainnet
```

This stage performs comprehensive local configuration:

**Role Assignments:**
- **MPC Vault** receives:
  - `MINTER_ROLE` - For minting tokens in business operations
  - `BURNER_ROLE` - For burning tokens in supply management
- **Dev Team** (if configured via `DEV_TEAM_ADDRESS`) receives:
  - `PROTOCOL_ADMIN_ROLE` - For configuring protocol settings
  - `ROUTER_ADMIN_ROLE` - For managing CrossChainRouter
  - `UPGRADER_ROLE` - For contract upgrades (redundancy with MPC vault)
  - `OPERATOR_ROLE` - On all infrastructure and protocol contracts
- **Bridge Modules** receive:
  - `MINTER_ROLE` and `BURNER_ROLE` - For burn-and-mint operations
  - `BRIDGE_ROLE` - For bridge-specific operations
- **LookCoin Contract** receives:
  - `BURNER_ROLE` - To enable direct LayerZero OFT functionality

**Infrastructure Setup:**
- Registers bridges with SupplyOracle for cross-chain tracking
- Configures CrossChainRouter with protocol modules (if deployed)
- Sets LayerZero endpoint for direct OFT transfers

### Stage 3: Configure

Establishes cross-chain connections between multiple networks:

```bash
# Configure cross-chain connections (only available for networks with deployment artifacts)
npm run configure:bsc-testnet
npm run configure:base-sepolia
npm run configure:optimism-sepolia
npm run configure:sapphire-mainnet
```

**Note**: Configure scripts are only available for networks that have deployment artifacts from other networks. This stage requires the `loadOtherChainDeployments()` function to scan the `/deployments` directory for JSON files from other networks to establish LayerZero trusted remotes, Celer IM remote modules, and cross-chain bridge registrations.

### Supply Management

- **Total Supply**: Configured in `hardhat.config.ts` as `TOTAL_SUPPLY` (currently 5 billion LOOK)
- **Home Chain**: BSC mints the full supply initially
- **Secondary Chains**: Start with 0 supply, receive tokens via bridges
- **Supply Monitoring**: SupplyOracle enforces the configured supply cap across all chains

### Unified JSON File Structure

The new unified JSON deployment system uses a standardized file structure in `/deployments/unified/`:

**File Naming Convention**:
- `basesepolia.unified.json` (Base Sepolia)
- `bsctestnet.unified.json` (BSC Testnet)
- `bscmainnet.unified.json` (BSC Mainnet)
- `optimismsepolia.unified.json` (Optimism Sepolia)
- `sapphiremainnet.unified.json` (Sapphire Mainnet)

**Enhanced Features**:
- **Schema v3.0.0**: Complete contract coverage with infrastructure support
- **Migration History**: Full audit trail of data transformations
- **Performance Indexing**: Fast contract lookups and protocol filtering
- **Cross-Network Validation**: Consistency checks across all deployments
- **Automatic Backups**: Timestamped backups in `/deployments/unified/backups/`

See [STATE_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md](docs/STATE_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md) for detailed file structure documentation and [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for deployment procedures.

### Execution Order

Always follow this sequence: **Deploy → Setup → Configure**

Currently, only 4 networks support all three stages because these are the only networks with the necessary deployment artifacts for cross-chain configuration.

### Supply Reconciliation

After deployment across multiple chains, use the reconciliation script to monitor and update cross-chain supply:

```bash
# Run reconciliation from any deployed network
npm run reconcile:bsc-testnet
npm run reconcile:base-sepolia
npm run reconcile:optimism-sepolia
```

The reconciliation script:
- Queries supply data from all deployed chains
- Calculates total supply across the ecosystem
- Updates SupplyOracle with accurate cross-chain data
- Detects supply discrepancies beyond tolerance threshold
- Triggers automatic bridge pausing if supply exceeds the configured total supply

**Note**: Reconciliation requires ORACLE_ROLE on the SupplyOracle contract.
