## Critical Issues

- ⚠️ 26 contracts are missing in unified format - DATA LOSS DETECTED
- ⚠️ Data preservation is 0.00% - NOT 100%

## Recommendations

- Investigate missing contracts and ensure all LevelDB data is properly migrated
- Achieve 100% data preservation before removing LevelDB dependencies
- Migration quality score below 90% - manual intervention required

## Quality Assessment

❌ **REQUIRES ATTENTION**: Significant data integrity issues must be resolved before proceeding.
